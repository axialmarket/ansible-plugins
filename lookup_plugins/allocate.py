    Allocate a list of items over another a list of "slots".

    Example:

      with_allocate:
          slots: ['a', 'b']
          items: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

    Result:

      -> [

          {'current': 5, 'slot' 'a'},
          {'current': 6, 'slot' 'b'},
         ]


    This will round-robin distribute items into slots, and returns a dictionary
    for each item and its assigned slot.

    Results can be accessed in Ansible as item.current, item.slot
